A shell similar to the terminal of Ubuntu has been programmed in C. To run the shell, download the files, go the directory and enter './shell.sh'.
The script file installs the required readline library and runs the makefile. The makefile, in turn, compiles the 'shell.c' program and generates the object file 'kjsrnvn'
Now enter './kjsrnvn' and boom. The shell starts and it functions similar to a normal terminal of Ubuntu.

Various system calls have been used in the C program. So, it is required to run the shell in Linux.
